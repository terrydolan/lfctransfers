# lfctransfers
This [lfctransfers notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/terrydolan/lfctransfers/blob/master/lfctransfers.ipynb) notebook analyses Liverpool Football Club's transfers over the last 5 seasons, from 2011-2012 to 2015-2016. 

The analysis uses IPython Notebook, python, pandas and matplotlib to investigate the data from lfchistory.net, transferleague.co.uk and the Deloitte football money league. The graphs are generated automatically from the munged data to help describe LFC's performance.
